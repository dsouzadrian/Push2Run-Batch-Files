 VBScript and Batch Files for Push2Run modules


1. LockComputer.bat
This is just a simple batch file to lock your computer. Can be called from push2run running on PC.

2. Spotify
This is a VBScript that will kill spotify if its already running and restart the program. It will then start playing the last played song, I've also included a command to skip to the next song so that it starts playing a new track rather than from somewhere in the middle.

The script also includes code to begin hueSync if the script was invoked after 6PM in the evening.

3. Youtube
This is a VBScript to play a song from youtube. The name of the song to played is passed in as an argument. 
This also contains code to begin light sync if the script was invoked after 6PM. 
The script can be invoked from push2Run and takes the name of the song as an argument. The name of the song is specified when you talk to your google home.

You can download push2Run here and follow the tutorials to get it setup with your google home.
